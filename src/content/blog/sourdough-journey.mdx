As a software engineer who's obsessed with efficiency and optimization, you might think bread baking would be frustrating. All that waiting, the imprecision, the dependence on temperature and humidity—it seems like the antithesis of controlled systems.

But here's what I discovered: sourdough is actually the perfect engineering problem.

## The Initial Challenge

I started my sourdough journey during my time at Microsoft, when I needed something tactile and analog to balance the digital work. My first few loaves were... let's call them "learning experiences." Dense, pale, more frisbee than bread.

But I'm not one to give up on optimization problems.

## The Engineering Approach

### 1. Establish a Baseline

Before you can optimize, you need consistent data. I started tracking:
- Water temperature
- Ambient temperature
- Fermentation times
- Hydration percentages
- Oven temperature and timing
- Results (crumb structure, rise, taste)

I built a simple spreadsheet to track each bake. Yes, I'm that person.

### 2. Iterate on One Variable at a Time

Classic A/B testing. I'd change one variable and keep everything else constant:
- Week 1-2: Baseline (70% hydration)
- Week 3-4: Higher hydration (75%)
- Week 5-6: Different flour blend
- And so on...

### 3. Understand the System

Sourdough is a living system—it's about:
- **Lactobacillus** bacteria producing lactic acid
- **Wild yeasts** creating CO2 for rise
- **Gluten development** for structure
- **Temperature** affecting fermentation speed
- **Time** as a variable you can control

Understanding this helped me predict outcomes and adjust in real-time.

## Key Optimizations

### Temperature Control is Everything

In software, we have staging environments. For sourdough, temperature IS your environment.

- **18-20°C**: Slow fermentation, better flavor development
- **24-26°C**: Faster fermentation, good for quick weeknight bakes
- **28°C+**: Too fast, can over-ferment quickly

I found that Oslo's cool apartments are actually ideal for long, cold fermentation. What seemed like a limitation became an advantage.

### The Float Test is Unreliable

Popular advice says to test if your starter is ready by seeing if it floats. Through iteration, I found this inconsistent. Better indicators:
- Doubling in size
- Domed surface with bubbles
- Time-based (4-6 hours at my room temp)

### Autolyse Makes a Difference

Mixing flour and water and letting it rest before adding starter and salt (autolyse) genuinely improves gluten development. I was skeptical—it seemed like unnecessary complexity. But the data (and crumb structure) proved me wrong.

## My Current Recipe

After hundreds of iterations, here's my optimized formula:

### Ingredients (for one loaf)
- 500g bread flour (I use a mix of wheat and rye)
- 375g water (75% hydration)
- 100g active sourdough starter (100% hydration)
- 10g salt

### Process

1. **Autolyse**: Mix flour and water, rest 30-60 minutes
2. **Add starter**: Mix thoroughly, rest 30 minutes
3. **Add salt**: Mix until fully incorporated
4. **Bulk fermentation**: 4-5 hours at ~20°C, with stretch-and-folds every 30 minutes for the first 2 hours
5. **Shape**: Pre-shape, rest 20 minutes, final shape
6. **Cold proof**: Refrigerate 12-16 hours
7. **Bake**: Dutch oven at 250°C, 20 minutes covered, 25 minutes uncovered

## Lessons for Software Engineers

What sourdough taught me about engineering:

1. **Not everything needs to be optimized immediately**: Sometimes systems need time
2. **Understand the fundamentals**: You can't optimize what you don't understand
3. **Constraints can be advantages**: Oslo's cool climate became a feature, not a bug
4. **Iteration beats perfection**: My 50th loaf was better than my 1st, my 100th better than my 50th
5. **Track your data**: You can't improve what you don't measure

## The Satisfaction of Craft

There's something deeply satisfying about pulling a perfect loaf from the oven—the sound of the crust crackling, the complex aroma, the texture of a good crumb.

It's analog, it's slow, and it's the perfect counterbalance to the digital, fast-paced world of software engineering.

Plus, bringing fresh sourdough to the office never hurts your popularity.

If you're a fellow engineer curious about sourdough, my advice: approach it systematically, but don't lose sight of the craft. It's both science and art, algorithm and intuition.

And yes, that spreadsheet is still going. I'm at bake #247 now.
